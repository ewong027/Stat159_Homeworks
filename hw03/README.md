## Multiple Regression Analysis

Homework Name: Stat159-Fall2016-HW03

Author: Erica Wong

Description: In this homework assignment, we are using the different tools that we have learned about to reproduce a simple regression analysis. Specifically, we are looking at Chapter 3 of _An Introduction to Statistical Learning_ by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani. [Here is a link to a PDF of their book.](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/%7Egareth/ISL/ISLR%20Sixth%20Printing.pdf) Specifically, we are looking at the analysis regarding the linear relationship between TV, Radio, Newspaper, and Sales.

Organization:

* Code: This folder contains all of my R Scripts. Within the code folder, the scripts are further divided into functions, scripts, and tests.
* Data: This folder contains all of the different data files that I have produced in this homework assignment.
* .gitignore: In the .gitignore file, we would put files and directories that we want to ignore in Git. In this project, we want to ignore files such as .Rhistory and .DS_Store, so that will be in our .gitignore file.
* Images: This folder contains all of my plots in both .png and .pdf form.
* Makefile: This files contains the commands that will run my different R scripts. Additonally, through Makefile, I am going to produce everything that exists in the data folder and the report.
* Report: This file contains my Report for this homework assignment in both .Rmd and .pdf form.
