## Overview of Code Folder

In this folder, you will find all of the Code scripts that I have written for HW02.

### Files in this Folder

* eda-script.R: This script uses information from Advertising.csv and computes summary statistics and histograms of `TV` and `Sales`. In this script, we also save out the histograms that we generated in both PDF and PNG form.
* regression-script.R: This script uses information from Advertising.csv and computes information regrading regression via the `lm()` function. We also comput the summary statistics of the regression object. Finally, this script will produce a scatterplot of the data with the regression line, save it into both PDF and PNG form, and save R objection from the regression analusis into the file regression.RData.
